= Best before date and expiry date

In the Pre-Award Catalogue Request, the contracting authority (CA) may ask for a certain vaccine to be offered. Because this vaccine is defined as 
perishable goods, the CA asks the economic operator (EO) to specify the best before date and expiry date in the tender. The fields will guide the CA 
in planning the vaccine program and logistics in regard to the country that it will be used in and when to order the vaccine. This information will 
also be used in the electronic catalogue if the EO must update information.


NOTE!!! Best-Before-Date and Expiry-Date are not a part of the pre-award catalogue request. Two possible solutions:

* Remove this chapter from this BIS.
* Add support in the transaction for a solution to request these dates to be sent. Propose to use cac:TransactionConditions.
