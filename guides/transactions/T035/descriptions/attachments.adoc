= Attachments

Attachments can be sent on line level in the Catalogue Request. This can be images or additional descriptions of a product. It is strongly recommended 
to use external references in the form of URI’s for attachments.

If binary objects are attached to the Pre-Award Catalogue Request, the valid values for mimetype can be found in section <<Mime code of attached document>>

.Example first of using an external reference, secondly using an attached binary object.
