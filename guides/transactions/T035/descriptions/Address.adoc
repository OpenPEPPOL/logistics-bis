= Despatch- and Delivery-Address

It is possible to specify in the Catalogue Request the Despatch- and the Delivery-Addresses both at header and line level. In the same message only one 
level must be used, not both. 

At Header level the cac:SellerSupplierParty shows the Despatch Address and cac:ContractorCustomerParty shows the Delivery address.  

At Line level both are presented in cac:ApplicableTerritoryAddress and separated by the cbc:AddressTypeCode. Besides these two address types there 
can also be other types of addresses. 

The addresses are not always relevant to include in the CatalogueRequest, but they will look like this when used. 


.Example - Addresses at Header level
include::{snippet-dir}/Snippet-1.xml[tags=addressH]

.Example - Addresses at Line level
include::{snippet-dir}/Snippet-1.xml[tags=addressL]
