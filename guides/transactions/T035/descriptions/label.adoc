= Labels and Requirements

The party requesting the pre-award catalogue may have have requirements related to the environment, fair trade and other factors. They may also demand 
that basic human rights are respected in the product production and trade. To be able to specify which of these criterias that are requested for each 
line, the Pre-Award Catalogue Request contains elements to document Environmental labelling and Social certificates. In the Catalogue the Supplier is
expected to confirm that the item fulfills these requirements by returning the labels. Detailed information about the different labels can be found 
on the issuing party’s web-site which is referred to via an URI.

Introducing these classification codes in pre-award catalogue request will support the aim for sustainable procurement, and make it possible to measure the 
purchasing behaviour and monitor that the requirements from the tendering process are fulfilled.

Furthermore, the Catalogue request sender may also have requirements regarding register enrollment, quality assurance standards or other relevant factors. 
These requirements may be met by the economic operator through certificates, self-declarations or other means of proof.

For this matter, eCertis may be used to specify both requirements and their means of proof. A guide to eCertis can be found here:
