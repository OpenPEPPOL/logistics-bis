[[terms]]
= Requested terms

If there is no previous contract to refer to, or if something needs to be different from the referred contract, any type of Trading terms can 
be specified. The type of term is set in cbc:Reference and the term itself will be found in cbc:Information. When more than one item is needed for 
the term, split the parts with “#” as in the example.
