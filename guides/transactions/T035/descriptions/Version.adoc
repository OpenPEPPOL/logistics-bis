[[version]]
= Version management

You can not specify a version in the Catalogue Request, but you may want to request a change or update of an existing pre-award Catalogue. 
In the request you then must pinpoint the Catalogue and version you request to be changed/updated. The new pre-award Catalogue will then have a 
new version number. 

.Example
include::{snippet-dir}/Snippet-1.xml[tags=version]
