[[keyword]]
= Keyword

Keywords are sent to let the Buyer search for a product without knowing the Product ID or name. Keywords can be repeated, but the number should 
be limited to ensure correct handling in the receiving system.  If more than one Keyword is sent, they should be put in the same tag separated 
by the %-sign since this is already being used by several actors (but a different sign can be agreed by the trading partners).
