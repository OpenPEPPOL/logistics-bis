= Attachments

Attachments can be sent on line level in the Catalogue. This can be images or additional descriptions of a product. It is strongly recommended 
to use external references in the form of URI’s for attachments.

If binary objects are attached to the PreAward Catalogue, the valid values for mimetype can be found in section <<Mime code of attached document>>
