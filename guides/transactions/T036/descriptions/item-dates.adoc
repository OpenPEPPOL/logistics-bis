[[item-dates]]
= Best before date and expiry date

In the Pre-Award Catalogue Request, the contracting authority (CA) may ask for a certain vaccine to be offered. Because this vaccine is 
defined as perishable goods, the CA asks the economic operator (EO) to specify the best before date and expiry date in the tender. The fields 
will guide the CA in planning the vaccine program and logistics in regard to the country that it will be used in and when to order the vaccine. 
This information will also be used in the electronic catalogue if the EO must update information.
