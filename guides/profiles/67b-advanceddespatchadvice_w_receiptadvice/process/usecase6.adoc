|*Use Case number* |6
|*Use Case Name* |Goods/service has been received too late.
|*Use Case Description* a|
This is the confirmation that the goods/service has arrived too late, but been received at a higher cost for the Consignee.

The Receipt Advice enables the goods receiver to inform the supplier that the goods/service arrived late, but was received by the Consignee anyway by asking personel to work overtime, creating a higher cost for the Consignee. 
A claim process for this will be started.
(At a later stage, when the Transport Handling Units are opened and the content is checked, an updated Receipt Advice may be sent.) 
This enables the Supplier to issue the corresponding invoice and be ready for the claim process to start.
