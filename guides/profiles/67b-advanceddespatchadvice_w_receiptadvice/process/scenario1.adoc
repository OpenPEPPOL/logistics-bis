= Scenario 1 - Process with sending Advanced Despatch Advice before the delivery of the goods

This process implies the sending of an Advanced Despatch Advice before the actual delivery has taken place. This enables the parties to correct any errors in the transactions and/or the delivery before the goods is transported from the Despatch party.

An Advanced Despatch Advice sent before the delivey may have a defined DespatchAdviceTypeCode, but if omitted, this is the default.

The following controls should be done by the consignee after reception of the Advanced Despatch Advice:

* Check that the message validates OK against all business rules
* Check that all parties are the correct ones.
* Check that the order reference is correct
* Check that any other references are correct

Based on these controls a Receipt Advice can be sent as the confirmation that the Advanced Despatch Advice
is correct, contains errors or just is received but not yet controlled.

When goods arrives and is received a new Recipt Advice can be created to report to the supplier quantities were ok or if there are issues to manage.
