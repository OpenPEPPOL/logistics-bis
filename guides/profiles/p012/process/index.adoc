| Category | Description
| Description | The contracting body sends the rejection of the qualification to the economic operator that submitted a qualification which was not accepted by the contracting authority. In case of accepting the submitted qualification, the contracting body may send a qualification response saying that the qualification has been accepted. This would be regarded as good practice when qualifications do not result directly in sending out any invitation to tender.

| Pre-conditions | Economic operators applied for participating in the tendering process and submitted their qualifications.
| Post-conditions | Those economic operators who received a qualification rejection will not be invited to tender in the next step of the tendering process.
