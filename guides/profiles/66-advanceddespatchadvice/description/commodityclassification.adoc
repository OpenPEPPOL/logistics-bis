= Commodity classification

Item classifications refer to the categorization or grouping of products or services based on various attributes such as type, purpose, industry standards, or any other relevant criteria. 
These classifications help in organizing and managing the vast array of items that a company might need to procure and follow up upon.

When procurement data is categorized based on item classifications and article numbers, it becomes easier to generate reports and conduct data analysis. This can help organizations identify spending patterns, track inventory levels, and make informed decisions about procurement strategies.

Besides the classification code itself, you need to include information on which code-list it belongs to. This you primarily do by referring to a @listID.
The @listID is linked to UNCL7143. Select the correct @listID there. You may also specify the version in @listVersionID.
If you use a codelist that is not in UNCL7143 you do like this:
1. Use "ZZZ" as the @listID.
2. Define the name of your codelist in attribute @name. You may also specify the version in @listVersionID.
