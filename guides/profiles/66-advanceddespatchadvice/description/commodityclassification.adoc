[[commodity-classification]]
= Commodity classification

Here you can add classification of the item. It can be the classification for customs purpose, 
but also a classification of waste or other classifications.

Besides the classification code itself, you need to include information on which code-list it belongs to. This you primarily do by referring to a @listID.
The @listID is linked to UNCL7143. Select the correct @listID there. You may also specify the version in @listVersionID.
If you use a codelist that is not in UNCL7143 you do like this:
1. Use "ZZZ" as the @listID.
2. Define the name of your codelist in attribute @name. You may also specify the version in @listVersionID.

.Example - to classify the item according to BEAst's codelist over SBMI items:
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=commodityclassification]
