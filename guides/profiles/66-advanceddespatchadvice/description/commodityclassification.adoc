[[commodity-classification]]
= Commodity classification

Here you can add classification of the item. It can be the classification for customs purpose, 
but also a classification of waste or other classifications.

Besides the classification code you need to provide information about the code in the attributes. 
In @listID you need to refer to a valid code in codelist UNCL7143. If there is none that matches, you can use ZZZ.
If you use ZZZ as @listID, you can in @listVersionID provide further information about the origin of the code.
The @name attribute is the key to the classification code and it must be provided if @listID is set to ZZZ. 

.Example - to classify the item according to BEAst's codelist over SBMI items:
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=commodityclassification]
