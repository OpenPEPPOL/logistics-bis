[[transport-handling-unit]]
= Transport handling unit

In the Advanced Despatch Advice you can provide a full description of how the packing structure is in up to four levels.
The top level is the TransportHandlingUnit (THU). A THU can be of different types - containers, pallets, boxes etc. The receiver will receive a THU as it is packed by the sender. The carrier will move it unchanged.
On a THU it is possible to pack items and/or packages. These packages can contain items and/or smaller packages, and these smaller packages items and/or even smaller packages. These can only contain items.
So it is possible to describe a structure where a package can be inside a bigger package that can be in a bigger package that is in a THU. See image below.
Additionally to this it is also possible to pack the THUs in a container.

[[transport-handling-unit-id]]
== Transport Handling Unit ID

Serial shipping container code (SSCC) issued by GS1 should be used to identify the transport handling unit. If the ID has the format of an SSCC, the
attribute @schemeID should be included to indicate it.
Note that the same physical handling unit may contain items from different despatch lines. 
Besides the ID you also need to provide a Type-code of the THU from the code-list.

.Example:
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=transporthandling]
----

[[transport-equipment]]
== Transport Equipment

In case the THU is a container, the container-specific data is defined here. 

.Example:
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=transportequipment]
----

[[goods-item]]
== Goods Item

If any item is packed directly in/on the THU, you specify that here. The ID is the reference to the DespatchLine/ID. All information about the item itself will be found on the Despatch Line.
Besides the ID you also need to provide information of the quantity packed in/on this THU.
Here also is a TraceID that can be used for multiple purposes. With the attribute schemeID you can describe what type of trace you use.

.Example:
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=goodsitemTHU]
----

[[package]]
== Package

If the THU contains any package, you specify that here.	You may give an ID on this package too, but it is optional. If the ID has the format of an SSCC, the
attribute @schemeID should be included to indicate it.
The type-code, however, you need to give.
Like for the THU you also can describe what is inside the package. There can be items and/or smaller packages.

.Example:
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=packageTHU]
----

[[containedpackage]]
== Contained Package

In the two last levels of the packing structure the ContainedPackage is used. They should be used the same way as described above for Package.

.Example:
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=containedpackage]
----

Finally an example of a full packing structure where the THU contains one goods item and one package, the package contains one goods item and one package,
this package contains again one goods item and one smaller package. Finally this package contains two goods items.

.Example:
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=fullstructure]
----
