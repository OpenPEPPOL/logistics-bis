[[environmental-data]]
= Environmental Data

The environmental data on header level resides within the OriginalDespatchTransportationService element and are 
.Transport Service Code, which is set to a fixed value of FuelReport since this is the only current application
.Transport Equipment, where the fuel consumption and related information resides for the transport
.Environmental Emission, that can contain CO~2~ and other emissions related to the transport or other service that consumes fuel.

[[fuel]]
== Fuel

The fuel consumption and related information regarding the fuel type to be used to caculate emissions tor the tansport or other service that consumes fuel.

The table below describes the definitions of the AttributeID:s.

[cols="2,4",options="header",stripes=even]
|====
|AttributeID |Definition
|ConversionFactor |Conversion and emission factor CO~2~ equivalent for calculating CO~2~ according to the fuel specified in the group. 
|DrivingDistance |Driving distance in kilometers that has been used for the assignment.
|DrivingTime |Driving time in hours that has been used for the assignment.
|EnergyContent |Amount of energy content (KWh) in the fuel specified in the group.
|EngineType |Environment class for the type of engine that has been used for the assignment.
|FuelConsumption |The consumed amount of fuel in the assignment.
|FuelMeasurementMethod |The method that the fuel consumption has been measured. 
|RenewableFuel |Share of renewable fuel in percent.

|====
|FuelMeasurementMethod |Definition
|AutomaticMeasurement |Automatic measurement via CAN bus, OBD2 or similar
|StandardEstimate |The values have been calculated by using standard consumption for a machine or vehicle.
|ManualMeasurement |The values have been calculated by manually measure, e.g. fuel consumption for a machine between two refueling occasions.

[[product-climate-data]]
== Product Climate Data

To be able to calculate product climate data the related CO~2~ value is needed and the weight of products are needed. 
The net weight per item is the recommended way to provide the weight information to the customer.
Example:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=itemnetweight]
----

In some cases the authority has specific requirements carbon accounting in regards to where the products are beeing used. This requiremnent can be fulfilled by the use of Buyers item identification.
Example:

[source, xml, indent=0]

[[generic-product-climate-data]]
=== Generic Product Climate Data

The generic product climate data is often provide from an authority and are related to a product category codes such as UNSPSC or similar.
Below you will find two examples from Swedish authorities that provides generic product climate data.

|Name |NameCode |listID |Definition
|Boverket Resource ID |ResourceID |Boverket | Resource ID according to the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning (Boverket)
|Trafikverket Resource ID |ResourceID |Trafikverket | Resource ID according to the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket)

[[epd]]
===  Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) 

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) provides specific CO~2~ data related to the product.
EPD:s are related to despatch line but since it is environmental related information it is presented in this section.

The table below describes the definitions of the EPD related properties.

[cols="1,1,1,3",options="header",stripes=even]
|====
|Name |NameCode |listID |Definition
|Program Operator |ProgramOperator |BEAST:4.0 |The name of the program operator that has published the EPD
|EPD Number |EPDNumber |BEAST:4.0 |The number of the published EDP
|EPD HR URL |EPDHRURL |BEAST:4.0 |URL to the human readable version of a EPD, for verification purposes
|EPD Product name |EPDProductName |BEAST:4.0 |The product name relating to an individual dataset in the EPD
|GWP GHG A1-3 EPD line value |GWP-GHG_A1-3_EPD |BEAST:4.0 |Global warming potential green house gases for process A1-3 100 EPD total value for line
|EPD Dataset ID |EPDDatasetID |BEAST:4.0 |The EPD dataset id gives the digital reference to a produkt type in the EDP
|EPD Dataset URL |EPDDataSetURL |BEAST:4.0 |URL to grab the machine readable digital information from the program operator
|====

The last properties are only used when the EPD is machine readable.
EPD PDF Product name is not needed if the EPD is machine readable.
