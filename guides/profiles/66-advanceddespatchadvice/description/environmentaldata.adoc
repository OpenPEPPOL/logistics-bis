[[environmental-data]]
= Environmental Data

The environmental data on header level resides within the OriginalDespatchTransportationService element and are 
.Transport Service Code, which is set to a fixed value of FuelReport since this is the only current application
.Transport Equipment, where the fuel consumption and related information resides for the transport
.Environmental Emission, that can contain CO~2~ and other emissions related to the transport or other service that consumes fuel.

[[fuel]]
== Fuel

The fuel consumption and related information regarding the fuel type to be used to caculate emissions tor the tansport or other service that consumes fuel.

[[product-climate-data]]
== Product Climate Data

To determine the CO~2~ equivalent in kilograms for the despatch line, the following calculation must be performed:

*CO~2~eq despatch line = (Net net weight) x (GWP GHG value per kilogram) x Quantity*

The GWP GHG value per kilogram can be either a generic value from an authority or specific value from an Enviromental Product Declaration (EPD).

To be able to calculate product climate data the related CO~2~ value and the weight of products are needed. 
The net weight per item is the recommended way to provide the weight information to the customer. See related information here: link:{ada-dir}/cac-DespatchLine/cac-Item/cac-Dimension/[cac-Dimension]

Example:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=itemnetweight]
----
Item identifiers are used for the receiver to understand what article has been received, at least one identifier is required, see related information here: <<item-description-and-identification>>
In some cases, the authority has specific requirements carbon accounting in regards to where the products are beeing used. This requirement can be fulfilled by the use of Buyers item identification. See related information here: 
link:{ada-dir}/cac-DespatchLine/cac-Item/cac-BuyersItemIdentification/[cac:BuyersItemIdentification]

[[generic-product-climate-data]]
=== Generic Product Climate Data

Generic product climate data is often provided from an authority and are related to a product category codes such as UNSPSC or similar.
Below you will find two examples from Swedish authorities that provide generic product climate data.

The list id IPNC is a reference to the code list link:{codelist-ItemPropertyNameCode}[Item Property Name Code (openPEPPOL)]

Table 8. Reference external generic climate data list.

[cols="1,1,1,3",options="header",stripes=even]
|====
|Name |NameCode |listID |Definition
|Boverket Resource ID |BoVResourceID |IPNC | A representative Resource ID according to the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning (Boverket) generic product type. Use NA as value if no relevant Resource ID exists.
|Trafikverket Resource ID |TrVResourceID |IPNC | A representative Resource ID according to the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) generic product type. Use NA as value if no relevant Resource ID exists.
|====

If no suitable generic value can be found in the resource lists, it is recommended to use 'NA' to indicate that there are no applicable resources available for the item.

[[epd]]
===  Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) 

Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) provides specific CO~2~ data related to the product.
EPD:s are related to despatch line but since it is environmental related information it is presented in this section.

Please note that "GWP-GHG" and "GWP-IOBC" are interchangable terms and can be used interchangeably, but in this document
"GWP-GHG" is used. The term "GWP-IOBC" is commonly utilized by certain program operators, which are organizations responsible for publishing Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs).
