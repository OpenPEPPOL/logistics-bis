[[shipment]]
= Shipment

Description of the actual shipment that contains the goods that are being despatched.

[[shipment-id]]
== Shipment ID

Normally the Freight Forwarder's identity of the shipment should be used.
If the ID is a GS1 GSID (Global Shipment Identification Number), it should be indicated by the attribute @schemeID. 
If it is not, the attribute can be omitted.
The Global Shipment Identification Number (GSIN) is a number that identifies a shipment and is assigned by the seller of goods. 
The goods shipper collects one or more logistic units for transportation to a recipient. A GSIN is assigned to this group of 
logistic units to identify them as a shipment.

In some uses of the Despath Advice, there is no unique identifier assigned to the shipment.
However, the UBL syntax requires the Shipment ID.
Consequently, to be able to use elements such as GrossWeightMeasure or CarrierParty, the Shipment/ID must be filled in.
To cater for scenarios where no ID exist a dummy value must be applied. The dummy value must consist of the characters **NA**.

include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=shipment]

[[vehicle-ID]]
== Vehicle ID

In some uses of the Despath Advice, there is a need to report the licence plate number or machine number, i.e. the vehicle ID.
If you need to specify more than one license plate number, use a semi-colon (;) between the license plate id:s. Place the License plate id of the truck 
before the one of the trailer. 
For foreign license plate numbers, set the countrycode in front of the license plate id, with a dash between. See example. If no countrycode is provided, 
a domestic license plate is assumed. 
If a license plate is unknown, use "UNKNOWN" as the license plate id. If a license plate is not relevant, use "NA" as the license plate id.

Example:

[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-30-1.xml[tags=vehicleid]
