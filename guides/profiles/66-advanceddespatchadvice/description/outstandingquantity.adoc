[[outstanding-quantity]]
= Outstanding quantity

The outstanding element on the Despatch line is both used to signal the outstanding quantity and to inform about delivery discrepancies.

The handling of “The outstanding quantity which will never be delivered” is done like this: The amount that is declared in the element OutstandingQuantity is equivalent to the amount that will be delivered in a later Despatch.
This implicitly means that the missing items that are NOT declared in the OutstandingQuantity can't or will not will be delivered.

*Example 1:*

10 items are ordered, 6 items are delivered and the rest of 4 items will be delivered later:

Quantity ordered: 10

Quantity delivered: 6

Outstanding quantity: 4
