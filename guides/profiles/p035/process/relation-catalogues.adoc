= Relation between different catalogues in the tendering process

.Definition of different catalogue types
****
Pre-award catalogue request::
A pre-award catalogue request is a catalogue of requirements on goods, services or works intended to be tendered by a CA. The CatalogueRequest is also 
called RequestForQuote (RFQ). It is sent by a Buyer to one or more potential Suppliers to retrieve prices and terms to purchase the products/services 
specified. 

Pre-award catalogue::
A pre-award catalogue is a catalogue that is used by an economic operator to provide the information on the offered goods, services or works as an answer 
to a call for tenders. In the case there is no Framework Agreement in place, or the terms are different from the ones in the Framework Agreement, the 
Pre-award Catalogue can contain terms that will apply to the prices. 

A pre-award catalogue can also be used as a stand-alone transaction without any preceding catalogue request transaction if the agreement to send one, 
and the content in it, is agreed between the parties in any other way. 

Electronic product catalogue::
An electronic product catalogue is a structured document describing goods, services or works that is available in a format so that it can be processed 
electronically. This is typically the post-award catalogue.

****

The pre-award catalogue will be created based on requirements from the tendering documents (RFQ), from the notification or from any other received request 
to send a pre-award Catalogue (Quote). Pre-award catalogues can be used in all procedures. In this description the input to the pre-award catalogue is based on a pre-award 
catalogue request. The pre-award catalogue request is the tool for the contracting authority (CA) to structure requirements for goods, services and works. 
The pre-award catalogue request contains a generic description of the needs to the CA. Based on the generic descriptions and requirements the economic 
operator (EO) creates a pre-award catalogue based on their own assortment of goods, services or works to fulfill the requirement of the CA.

Example of generic descriptions can be classifications systems such as UNSPSC, CPV or eCl@ss. Examples of generic requirements are code lists for 
environment, social and ecological labels or labels that is equivalent. It can be a certification/attestation of certain skills as surgical nurse, 
midwife, different kinds of engineers or other speciality of occupation.
The CA has stored the generic description and requirements from the pre-award catalogue request in the tendering system and can undertake an automated 
evaluation of the different offers from different EO´s with the pre-award catalogue as a structured and standardized input.

After the evaluation process, the pre-award catalogue will be stored and after signing the contract with the EO it will be transferred to the 
eProcurement system (catalogue tool) to be used as baseline. The purpose is to check the electronic product catalogue toward the contract in order to 
know when or if the EOs can update the catalogue.

Using catalogues in the tendering process will save processing time both for the EO and CA and will enhance transparency and traceability of goods, 
services and works. To achieve good and effective processes the EO should have their own eSubmission systems based on a 4-corner model to be able to 
communicate with different tendering platforms based on standard formats and Peppol branches of CEF eDelivery.
