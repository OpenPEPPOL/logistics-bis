= Code list for elements

.The following policies apply to the use of codes for returning the processing status of a transaction via Message Response Codes and Status Reason Codes:
* There are three Message Response Codes which define the final processing result.
* There are eleven pre-defined Status Reason Codes which define the reason why a received and reference document could not be processed correctly.
* Lists of Message Response Codes and Status Reason Codes are fixed and can not be changed bilaterally.
* Message Response Codes and Status Reason Codes are returned from the receiver of a document to the sender of a document to inform the sender of the document about the final processing results and reasons in case of failure or processing problems.

.The columns in the below table shall be understood as follows:
[horizontal]
Message Response Code:: The code that defines the final processing result of the referenced and received document, e.g. AP for Accepted.

Name of the Message Response Code:: The name of the code.

Usage of the Message Response Code:: The usage of the code.

Example:: Example of a use case for the code.

Possible Status Reason Code:: Status Reason code which could be used to lead to the Message Response Code.

[IMPORTANT]
Due to legal framework conditions, there is a constraint to tolerate errors to a certain extent when receiving a tender, even if from a technical point of view, the message might have to be rejected. Especially tender rejections have to be kept to a minimum and must be based on valid reasons. These have to withstand judicial review.

.The Message Response Codes used in a Tendering Message Response message are defined in the table below.

|Possible Status Reason Code
|RE |Rejected |Response code is used when the receiver will not process the referenced message any further. The reason for rejecting the message shall be stated in ´Status Reason´. |The received Tender has been rejected due to a fatal business rule violation (BV) |BV, SV, NF, DL, RF, WT, IR, MA, AE, PT
|AP |Accepted |Response code is uses when the referenced message has been accepted by the receiver. | The received Tender has been accepted.| none
|CA |Conditionally accepted |Response code is used when the receiver is accepting the message under conditions stated in ‘Status Reason’ and proceed to continue the process unless disputed by the sender.| The received Tender has only been conditionally accepted due to an expired tender submission deadline. The Contracting Authority is investigating the incident in a separate process. | BW, DL, IR

.The columns in the below table shall be understood as follows:

Status Reason Code:: The code that defines the reason why a received and reference document could not be processed correctly e.g. BW for Business rule violation, warning.

Name of the Status Reason Code:: The name of the code.

Usage of the Status Reason Code:: The usage of the code.

Example:: Example of a use case for the code.

Possible resulting Message Response Code:: Message Response Codes which could be the results of the usage of the status reason code.

|Usage of the Status Reason Code
|Example
|Possible resulting Message Response Code
|BV |Business rule violation, fatal |Error associated with a business rule that indicates a problem that leads to the rejection of the referenced message. |A Tenderings Questions transaction does not contain a question. |RE
|BW |Business rule violation, warning |Warning related to a business rule that indicates a problem but that does not hinder further processing at this point in time.| A Tendering Answers transaction includes a cbc:CopyIndicator that is not required according to the specifications.| CA
|SV |Syntax violation |Error associated with a syntax violation that indicates a problem that leads to the rejection of the referenced message.| The retrieved Tendering Questions transaction does not adhere to the UBL syntax for Enquiry.| RE
|NF |Reference not found|Error caused by a document reference given in the received message that could not be found. Leads to the rejection of the received message.| The Tender or procedure to which Tender Withdrawal is referencing was not found.|RE
|DL |Deadline expired | Error caused by a received message that was not submitted on time. Depending on the procedure availability and elapsed time period, the message may be rejected or conditionally accepted as a result.| The tender submission deadline has expired before the retrieval of a Tender.| RE/CA
|RF |Request failed |Error caused by a received message that cannot be processed further for technical reasons. Leads to rejection of the received message.| An undefined technical error occurred so that a Call for Tender update could not be processed by the receiver.| RE
|WT |Wrong transaction flow| Error caused to a received message that was not sent in the expected sequence of the business process. Leads to the rejection of the received message.|A Tender Status Inquiry transaction is sent before the Subscribe to Procedure transaction.|RE
|IR |Invalid request| Error caused by a received message that cannot be processed further for semantic or business reasons.  The message may be rejected or conditionally accepted as a result.|A Tender that was submitted contains false Contracting Authority information that cannot be processed by the receiver.| RE/CA
|MA |Missing authorisation|Error caused by a received message that could not be processed further due to a missing authorization or approval for the procedure. Leads to the rejection of the received message.| A Subscribe to Procedure cannot be confirmed because the subscriber has not been approved for the restricted procedure.| RE
|AE |Authentication exception | Error caused by a received message that could not be processed further due missing authentication or registration for the procedure. Leads to the rejection of the received message.|A Tender is submitted for an economic operator that is not subscribed for the procedure.|RE
|PT |Process termination | A query response of a Search Notice Request is cancelled or terminated.|A Search Notice Response sent in several replies is aborted by the recipient because searched information has already been found.|RE
