|*Use Case number* |8
|*Use Case Name* |Goods has been received with a missing Transport Handling Unit.
|*Use Case Description* a|
This is the confirmation that the goods has arrived with a Transport Handling Unit missing.

The Receipt Advice enables the goods receiver to inform the supplier that the goods/service arrived with a Transport Handling Unit missing. 
A claim process for this will be started with the Supplier or Carrier depending on who is responsible for transportation.
(At a later stage, when the Transport Handling Units are opened and the content is checked, an updated Receipt Advice may be sent.) 
This enables the Supplier to issue the corresponding invoice and be ready for the claim process to start.
