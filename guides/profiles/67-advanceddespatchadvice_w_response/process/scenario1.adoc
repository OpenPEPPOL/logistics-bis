= Scenario 1 - Process with response before the delivery of the goods

This process implies the sending of an Advanced Despatch Advice and return of the Advanced Despatch Advice Response before the actual delivery has taken place. This enables the parties to correct any errors in the transactions and/or the delivery before the goods are transported from the Despatch party.

An Advanced Despatch Advice sent before the delivey should have a defined DespatchAdviceTypeCode.

The following controls should be done by the consignee after reception of the Advanced Despatch Advice:

* Check that the message validates OK against all business rules
* Check that the order reference is correct
* Check that any other references are correct
