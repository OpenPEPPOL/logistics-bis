= Shipment

A shipment is the contractual arrangement whereby an identifiable collection of goods items is to be transported from one party (the Consignor) to another 
party (Consignee). The Shipment is a mandatory element in the Waybill. There is one and only one shipment in a Waybill. A Shipment contains the consignment 
and the Goods Items being transported. The shipment ID is an important identifier that tracks the transport of the goods, door to door. 
If the ID is a GS1 GSIN (Global Shipment Identification Number), it should be indicated by the attribute @schemeID. If it is not, the attribute can be omitted.
The Global Shipment Identification Number (GSIN) is a number that identifies a shipment and is assigned by the seller of goods. The goods shipper
collects one or more logistic units for transportation to a recipient. A GSIN is assigned to this group of logistic units to identify them as a shipment.
