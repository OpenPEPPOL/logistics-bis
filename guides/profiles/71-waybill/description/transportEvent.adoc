= Transport event

The transport event supports an event-oriented document exchange. It represents a time and a location where the event took or is supposed to take place. The context (name) of the event indicates why it is applied. The transport events used in the Transport Execution Plan are:

* Requested Pickup Transport Event
* Planned Pickup Transport Event
* Requested Delivery Transport Event
* Planned Delivery Transport Event
* Requested Departure Transport Event
* Planned Departure Transport Event
* Requested Arrival Transport Event
* Planned Arrival Transport Event

The difference in requested and actual is that the requested event comes from the Transport user and the actual event comes from the Transport service provider.
