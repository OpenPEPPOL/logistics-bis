= Principles and prerequisites

This chapter describes the principles and assumptions that underlie the use of the Transport Execution Plan.

The Transport Execution Plan is used to give instructions for the transportation services required for a consignment of goods to any party who is contracted to provide the transportation services. 
The Transport Execution Plan is initially sent from the Transport Service provider but may later be changed or cancelled by both the Transport User and the Transport Service Provider.
