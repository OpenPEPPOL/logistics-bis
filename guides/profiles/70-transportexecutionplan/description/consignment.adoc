= Consignment

A consignment is the transportation of an identifiable collection of goods items from one party (the consignor) to another (the consignee) via one or more 
modes of transport. There are often conflicts between the terms "Shipment" and "Consignment", but in this model the Shipment is focused on the contract and 
the movement of the goods (what is being shipped), while the Consignment is focused on the service of moving the goods (how it will be done). The consignment 
can consist of a number of transport handling units, the shipment stages relate to how they are transported and the events during the transport. 
If the ID is a GS1 GINC (Global Identification Number for Consignment), it should be indicated by the attribute @schemeID. If it is not, the attribute can be 
omitted. This number identifies a consignment, which is a logical grouping of goods (one or more logistics units) transferred to a freight forwarder to be
transported for a specific journey. The consignment number must be allocated by a freight forwarder (or a carrier acting as a freight forwarder) or a
consignor, but only if prior agreement of the freight forwarder is given.
