[[commodity-classification]]
= Commodity classification

Here you can add classification of the item. It can be the classification for customs purpose, 
but also a classification of waste or other classifications.

Besides the classification code you need to provide information about the code in the attributes. 
In @listID you need to refer to a valid code in codelist UNCL7143. The selected @listID may need further information in @listVersionID and/or @name.
 
If there is no code in UNCL7143 that matches your requirements, you can use ZZZ.
If you use ZZZ as @listID, then the real list ID (the codelist ID) is defined in the @name. The @listVersionID then becomes the version of @name. 

.Example - to classify the item according to the codelist over SBMI items:
[source, xml, indent=0]
----
include::{snippet-dir}/snippet-1.xml[tags=commodityclassification]
