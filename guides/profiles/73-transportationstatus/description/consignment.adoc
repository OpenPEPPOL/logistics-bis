= Consignment

In this profile consignment is used to identify any transport events or transport handling units that it is requested status on. If the ID is a GS1 GINC 
(Global Identification Number for Consignment), it should be indicated by the attribute @schemeID. If it is not, the attribute can be omitted.
This number identifies a consignment, which is a logical grouping of goods (one or more logistics units) transferred to a freight forwarder to be
transported for a specific journey. The consignment number must be allocated by a freight forwarder (or a carrier acting as a freight forwarder) or a
consignor, but only if prior agreement of the freight forwarder is given.
