= Introduction to OpenPeppol and BIS

This {link-peppol} BIS provides a set of specifications for implementing a {link-peppol} business process. The document is concerned with clarifying requirements for ensuring interoperability of pan-European Public eProcurement and provides guidelines for the support and implementation of these requirements. This document is based on work done by {link-bii3}.

The {name-profile} describes electronic messaging support for the business process to identify and verify the capabilities of any economic operator that wants to present an offer in a particular tendering procedure (pre-awarding phase). It is for the business process of tendering in a pre-awarding phase. It is intended for use by businesses and purchasing authorities in procedures where access to participation is restricted to qualified economic operators. The key aspects covered by this BIS are:

    * An economic operator can use this BIS {P011} to submit qualification documents to a contracting authority as specified in the Call for Tender documents.
    * The BIS can be used for qualification as part of a restricted, negotiated or competitive dialogue tendering procedure. The qualification transaction is specific to a particular call for tenders.
    * The contracting body confirms the reception of the qualification documents using BIS {P011}.
    * Out of scope: The contracting body evaluates the qualification information and reports his decision, positive or negative, to the economic operator. The decision reporting is out of the scope of this BIS. In any case, every economic operator having applied by sending in their qualification documents will receive a {P012}. While a positive response will soon be followed by the invitation to submit a tender (not in scope of this BIS), covered by Peppol BIS {P013}. Those who have been informed that their qualification has been rejected are excluded from the ongoing procurement process by the contracting authority.

In an open procedure this profile is not used but the qualification may be sent together with the tender, an economic operator submits. Submitting a tender with qualification is defined in {P003}.

The purpose of this document is to facilitate an efficient implementation and increased use of electronic collaboration regarding the tendering process based on these formats.
