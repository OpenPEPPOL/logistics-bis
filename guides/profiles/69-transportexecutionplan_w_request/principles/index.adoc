= Principles and prerequisites

This chapter describes the principles and assumptions that underlie the use of the Transport Execution Plan with Request.

The Transport Execution Plan Request and the Transport Execution Plan are used to give instructions for the transportation services required for a consignment of goods to any party who is contracted to provide the transportation services. A Transport Execution Plan Request is used by a Transport User to request if a Transport Service Provider can provide the required service. A Transport Execution Plan is used by the Transport Service Provider as a response to the request from the Transport User. 
A Transport Execution Plan is also used as a receipt message to confirm or reject a change or cancellation of the plan from either the Transport User or the Transport Service Provider. 

A Transport Execution Plan may also be forwarded to a Freight Forwarder or a Carrier involved in the transportation.
