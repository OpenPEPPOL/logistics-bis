[[consignment]]
= Consignment

A consignment is the transportation of an identifiable collection of goods items from one party (the consignor) to another (the consignee) via one or more modes of transport. There are often conflicts between the terms "Shipment" and "Consignment", but in this model the Shipment is focused on the contract and the movement of the goods (what is being shipped), while the Consignment is focused on the service of moving the goods (how it will be done). The consignment can consist of a number of transport handling units, the shipment stages relate to how they are transported and the events during the transport.
