[[environmental-data]]
= Environmental data

The environmental data on header level resides within the OriginalDespatchTransportationService element and are 
.Transport Service Code, which is set to a fixed value of FuelReport since this is the only current application
.Transport Equipment, where the fuel consumption and related information resides for the transport
.Environmental Emission, that can contain CO2 and other emissions related to the transport or other service that consumes fuel.

[[fuel]]
== Fuel

The fuel consumption and related information regarding the fuel type to be used to caculate emissions tor the tansport or other service that consumes fuel.

The table below describes the definitions of the AttributeID:s.

|====
|AttributeID |Definition
|ConversionFactor |Conversion and emission factor CO2 equivalent for calculating CO2 according to the fuel specified in the group. 
|DrivingDistance |Driving distance in kilometers that has been used for the assignment.
|DrivingTime |Driving time in hours that has been used for the assignment.
|EnergyContent |Amount of energy content (KWh) in the fuel specified in the group.
|EngineType |Environment class for the type of engine that has been used for the assignment.
|FuelConsumption |The consumed amount of fuel in the assignment.
|FuelMeasurementMethod |The method that the fuel consumption has been measured.
